Should figure out how to say
	 More research is needed to reduce the sample complexity.
	 Dataset enables transfer learning research 
		? If I know dense rewards on previous tasks and give a new task with sparse rewards)
		? Family of tasks 
\One shot learning by demonstrations.


Emphasize the fact that this is an open world envitronment. 
	 One thing that is missing in RL is a huge scale multitasking environment (Imagenet vs CIFAR-10) 
	 Survival data is segmented by obtaining items and therefore we can produce as many tasks as there are items to

Competition Notes:
	1. Here's the data. How much faster can you solve this task (how many frames does it take to solve this task)
	2. Combination of sample complexity 
	3. Releasable models for the competition track.
