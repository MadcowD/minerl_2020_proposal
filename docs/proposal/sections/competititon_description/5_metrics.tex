Following training, participants will be evaluated on the average score of their model over 500 episodes.
Scores are computed as the sum of the milestone rewards achieved by the agent in a given episode as outlined in Table~\ref{table:rew}. 
A milestone is reached when an agent obtains the first instance of the specified item. 
Ties are broken by the number of episodes required to achieve the last milestone. 
An automatic evaluation script will be included with starter code. 
For official evaluation and validation, a fixed map seed will be selected for each episode. These seeds will not be available to participants during the competition.
