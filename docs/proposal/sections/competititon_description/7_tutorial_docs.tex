\subsection{Tutorial and documentation}

We have a competition page that contains instructions, documentation\footnote{\url{http://minerl.io/docs/}}, and updates to the competition. 
For this competition, we plan to include a step-by-step demonstration showing participants how to submit their learning procedures.
Although top participants in MineRL 2019 stated that they found the documentation to be helpful, we plan to extend the documentation in the hopes that even more people can participate this year.
