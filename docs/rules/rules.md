Structure generation and all mob spawning will be disabled.  
Gamma will be set to 0.5

## Agents

Hard-coded agents are not allowed.  
Hard coding consists of using pre-defined logic to influence game behavior. Meta-controllers and otherwise must be dependent on learned parameters and may not be encoded, source code or otherwise by participants.
